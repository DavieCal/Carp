  abstract = {The reproduction of carp Cyprinus carpio L. (Family: Cyprinidae), from Victorian waters in Australia, is studied with detailed analysis of gonad maturation, spawning season, fecundity and oocyte diameter. Results show that carp has a high annual fecundity (AF) (0.12{\textendash}1.54 million oocytes per fish), which is positively correlated with caudal fork-length (L, mm) and total weight (W, kg) but not age. The relationships between length or weight and AF were statistically significant and best described with the simple linear or quadratic regressions. Mean relative fecundity was 0.163 million eggs kg-1 whole weight. Egg size was estimated from oocyte diameter in carp from eight stocks. Egg size was proportional to maternal size but not age. Seasonal trends in gonadosomatic indices, together with the changes in the macroscopic and microscopic condition of ovaries, demonstrated that spawning generally peaks during spring{\textendash}early summer, but also occurs through until autumn and can even start in late winter at some sites. In Victoria, this species is a multiple spawner with asynchronous oocyte development and a protracted spawning season. Stocks generally contain both females that spawn once, and females that spawn repeatedly, within a spawning season. Implications for management for the control of feral carp stocks are discussed.},

We hypothesized that climate factors correlated across a broad geographical scale (i.e., the Moran effect) would induce synchrony in recruitment for common carp Cyprinus carpio among 18 glacial lakes across a 175-km2 area in eastern South Dakota. Cross-correlation analysis indicated that common carp population fluctuations were highly synchronous among lakes. To evaluate the influence of the Moran effect on recruitment, we examined several candidate models using an information-theoretic approach. The model with the most support included the interaction of temperature, precipitation, and wind during the open-water period. This model indicated that the effects of any one of these climate variables on recruitment strength depended on the level of each of the other variables in any given year. Our results suggest that common carp populations in the Midwestern United States exhibit synchronous recruitment across regionwide geographic areas as a result of climatic variability.},

  abstract = {Why certain species of fish become invasive is poorly understood and a key obstacle to restoring many of the world's ecosystems. In this study we tested whether variation in biotic resistance exerted by native predators might explain the reproductive success of the common carp, a large and fecund invasive species that typically spawns in outlying and unstable shallow habitat. An initial three-year study of the relative abundance of young-of-year (YOY) carp in interconnected lakes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin discovered that YOY carp are only found in shallow waters that experience winter hypoxia (winterkill) and have low densities of the native egg-predators that otherwise dominate these locales. A follow-up experiment tested if native fish predation on carp eggs could explain this distribution. It found that while carp eggs survived in winterkill lakes, they only survived in non-winterkill lakes when protected by a mesh that excluded fish. Large numbers of carp eggs were found in the stomachs of native fish inhabiting lakes that did not winterkill. We conclude that common carp, and likely many other highly mobile and fecund invasive fish, have evolved life histories to avoid egg predators and can become invasive when they are absent.},

Movement patterns of common carp in the Murray River were investigated between November 1999 and August 2001. In total, 3337 common carp were boat electric fished and externally tagged. Of the 293 (8.8\%) fish recaptured, up to 1898~days later, the majority (80\%) moved \ensuremath{<}5~km. However, over 7\% of the tagged population moved \ensuremath{\geq}100~km, and the maximum distance was 890~km. Intermediate-sized males moved the greatest distances, usually downstream. Conversely, females and larger males remained close to floodplain spawning areas. For improved management, there is a need to recognise different movement strategies within common carp populations.},

In this study, movements associated with the establishment of home ranges by golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in an Australian lowland river were examined using radiotelemetry. To examine behaviour associated with exploration and settlement into new home ranges, fish were artificially translocated into an unfamiliar river section.

  abstract = {Common Carp Cyprinus carpio form dense populations that often negatively impact water quality and clarity, native fish communities, and aquatic plant growth in aquatic ecosystems outside their native range, including the U.S. Midwest. In an attempt to guide future management and control activities, we used acoustic telemetry to quantify monthly spatial distributions and movement patterns for adult Common Carp in Brant and Round lakes, South Dakota, during open-water periods for 2 years. During a span of 12 months of manual tracking in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, we obtained 530 locations from 19 acoustically tagged fish. In general, fish displayed a clear tendency to aggregate in shallow depths close to shore during the spawning period in May and June and also postspawn during August. In contrast, fish dispersed offshore into deeper water during July. Mean hourly movement rates during 24-h tracking sessions ranged from 100.3 m/h to 165.9 m/h. Although nonsignificant, the highest movement rates occurred in June and October and during the dusk period. Our results, along with similar studies in the region, indicate predictable and repeatable seasonal aggregations and distributions of Common Carp that will likely aid in the development of sampling protocols and control programs for temperate lakes. These results can be used to develop integrated control techniques that would target adult fish during periods of seasonal aggregations and dispersions, which is critical for effective population control.Received March 26, 2014; accepted August 23, 2014},

However, we discovered that both of these species were only attracted to conspecific odours. Conspecific attraction was not influenced by immediate previous experience or accompanied by changes in feeding activity, suggesting it is pheromonally mediated. We hypothesize that carp and their relatives recognize each other using relatively complex mixtures of multiple classes of body metabolites.

Temporal changes in distribution of juvenile carp and sub-adult carp, and high biomass density and slightly larger carp sizes in slope populations, indicated that slope sites were `sinks' for downstream `source' populations. The distribution of sub-adult carp also suggested that recruitment differed between regulated and unregulated lowland sites, and unregulated sites had proportionately more sub-adult carp in the total catch.

  abstract = {Modelling the local density of tropical saplings can provide insights into the ecological processes that drive species regeneration and thereby help predict population recovery after disturbance. Yet, few studies have addressed the challenging issues in autocorrelation and zero-inflation of local density. This paper presents Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) of sapling density that includes these two features. Special attention is devoted to variable selection, model estimation and comparison.

We developed a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with a latent correlated spatial structure and compared it with non-spatial ZIP and Poisson models that were either autocorrelated (Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed, SGLM) or not (generalized linear models, GLM). In our spatial models, local density autocorrelation was modeled by a Conditional Auto-Regressive (CAR) process. 13 explicative variables described ecological conditions with respect to topography, disturbance, stand structure and intraspecific processes. Models were applied to six tropical tree species with differing biological attributes: Oxandra asbeckii, Eperua falcata, Eperua grandiflora, Dicorynia guianensis, Qualea rosea, and Tachigali melinonii. We built species-specific models using a simple method of variable selection based on a latent binary indicator.

Our spatial models showed a close correlation between observed and estimated densities with site spatial structure being correctly reproduced. By contrast, the non-spatial models showed poor fits. Variable selection highlighted species-specific requirements and susceptibility to local conditions. Model comparison overall showed that the SGLM was the most accurate explanatory and predictive model. Surprisingly, zero-inflated models performed less well.

Although the SZIP model was relevant with respect to data distribution, and more flexible with respect to response curves, its model complexity caused marked variability in parameter estimates. In the SGLM, the spatial process alone accounted for zero-inflation in the data. A refinement of the hypotheses employed at the process level could compensate for distribution flaws at the data level. This study emphasized the importance of the HBM framework in improving the modelling of density{\textendash}environment relationships.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Environmental data are spatial, temporal, and often come with many zeros. In this paper, we included space-time random effects in zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and `hurdle' models to investigate haulout patterns of harbor seals on glacial ice. The data consisted of counts, for 18 dates on a lattice grid of samples, of harbor seals hauled out on glacial ice in Disenchantment Bay, near Yakutat, Alaska. A hurdle model is similar to a ZIP model except it does not mix zeros from the binary and count processes. Both models can be used for zero-inflated data, and we compared space-time ZIP and hurdle models in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Space-time ZIP and hurdle models were constructed by using spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models and temporal first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) models as random effects in ZIP and hurdle regression models. We created maps of smoothed predictions for harbor seal counts based on ice density, other covariates, and spatio-temporal random effects. For both models predictions around the edges appeared to be positively biased. The linex loss function is an asymmetric loss function that penalizes overprediction more than underprediction, and we used it to correct for prediction bias to get the best map for space-time ZIP and hurdle models.
